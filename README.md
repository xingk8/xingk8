## 👋About Me

<p>⚡️  I am a 3rd year electrical and biomedical engineering student at McMaster University </p>
<p>🚙  Currently working at Stellantis as an Electrical Engineering Intern focused on battery cell development and testing. </p>
<p>🏁  Currently a member of the McMaster Battery Workforce Competition team, where I mainly contribute to PCB design, testing, and hardware validation. </p>
<p>⚒️ Passionate about PCB layout and hardware design. </p>

**Some of My Projects:**
<br>

-  **LIDAR Spatial Mapping Device:**
    - Engineered a microcontroller-based 3D LIDAR system using the VL53L1X ToF sensor, UNL2003 stepper motor, and MSP432E401Y micrcontroller.
    - Used C++ firmware in Keil uVision to coordinate sensor measurements and motor control via UART communication.
    - Visualized 3D point cloud data using Open3D library in Python to generate real-time 360° spatial mapping of the environment.

-  **Snake Game:**
    - Created a classic snake game with real-time movement, collision detection, score tracking, and game-over logic. Designed an intuitive grid-based interface with keyboard controls and responsive gameplay.
    - Used programming principles and data structures in C/C++ to implement game loop logic, dynamic growth mechanics, boundary and self-collision detection, and real-time input handling to simulate classic arcade gameplay.

-  **DC Power Supply:**
   - Designed and built a low-voltage DC power supply from a high-voltage AC input using a transformer, rectifier, and filter components.
   - Focused on achieving a stable and reliable output voltage suitable for powering low-current devices.
   - Verified performance through simulation and hands-on measurements, with results closely matching design expectations.
